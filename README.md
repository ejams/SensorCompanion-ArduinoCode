# SensorCompanion-ArduinoCode
The code for the Arduino portion of the my SensorCompanion project.

To use, download the Arduino source file and load it in the Arduino IDE. Once your Arduino is configured with the IDE, flash the code to it. If your Arduino is set up the same as I have below in the diagram, the HC-05 module should begin blinking as it is looking for a connection. Once a connection is established to the associated SensorCompanion Android app, the module will change its blinking period to indicate a successful connection, and you should start receiving sensor data.

*Before using, ensure that the HC-05 has been paired in the Bluetooth settings of the Android device with pair code 1234 as default.
